# Main SCAD Files for Compilation

This file lists all the main OpenSCAD files in this repository that should be compiled to STL format.

## Compilation List

The following SCAD files are automatically compiled by the CI workflow:

### Base Components
- `bottom.scad` - Bottom enclosure component
- `lid-mid360.scad` - Lid for Mid-360 LiDAR configuration

### Camera Mounts (Cameras/)
- `Cameras/UC_261.scad` - UC-261 camera mount
- `Cameras/UC_A173.scad` - UC-A173 camera mount  
- `Cameras/UC_261_Mid360.scad` - UC-261 camera mount with Mid-360 cover
- `Cameras/UC_A173_LidarCover.scad` - UC-A173 camera mount with LiDAR cover

### LiDAR Covers (LidarCover/)
- `LidarCover/Mid360Cover.scad` - Mid-360 LiDAR protective cover

## Module/Library Files (Not Standalone)

The following files are modules/libraries and should NOT be compiled individually:
- `constants.scad` - Shared constants and dimensions
- `Cameras/CameraMount.scad` - Camera mount module library
- `raspberry/rpi5_negative.scad` - Raspberry Pi 5 mounting module
- `system_mid360.scad` - Assembly/visualization file (contains multiple components)

## CI/CD Workflow

All main SCAD files listed above are automatically compiled to STL on:
- Push to `main` or `master` branch
- Pull requests to `main` or `master` branch
- Manual workflow dispatch

The compiled STL files are available as downloadable artifacts from the GitHub Actions workflow runs.

## Local Compilation

To compile a specific file locally:
```bash
openscad -o output.stl input.scad
```

Example:
```bash
openscad -o bottom.stl bottom.scad
```
